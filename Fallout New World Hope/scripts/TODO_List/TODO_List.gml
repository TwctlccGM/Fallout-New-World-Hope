/*
/// BUGS AND STUFF TO FIX

- Items (stims and doc bags) get consumed even when they have no effect.
- Turn repeated code (e.g. item pickups) into a function for easier usage and reading.
- Items used in battle that have not yet been added to the inventory array crash the game.

/// FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

- Ability to add/remove party members in-game.
- Keys/Keycards to unlock doors.
- Dialogue system.
- More scalable item system (right now each item is just a duplicate of the stimpak code with a different function used)
	- Maybe implement a better 'item' variable so that the item id in the item array doesn't need to be checked so much
- More items (Battle Brew, Med-X, Keycards)
